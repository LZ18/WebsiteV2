        <p>
            The iPad attendance app is a SwiftUI-based tool built to track morning sign-ins, afternoon sign-outs,
            and notes for 1,000+ students (and growing). Staff load rosters from CSV, tap campers to mark attendance,
            view a weekly grid, and export CSV reports. Data is stored locally for offline use and synced in real time
            via Firebase Cloud Firestore, organized by week for fast queries. Firestore listeners keep multiple devices
            updated instantly, while batched writes and composite indexes maintain performance at scale.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security is handled through Firestore Security Rules, Firebase Auth (recommended), and App Check to ensure
            only authorized staff devices can read/write. Apple Developer setup includes creating an App ID, certificates,
            and provisioning profiles (development for testing, distribution for TestFlight or MDM). Xcode manages
            build/signing. Firebase is integrated via Swift Package Manager, and the app is deployed through TestFlight,
            Ad Hoc, or MDM for fleet devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The architecture consists of SwiftUI views (Home, Live Attendance, Week Overview, Camper Profile), models
            (Camper, attendance dictionaries), and a ViewModel that parses CSVs, manages state, and handles Firestore
            reads/writes. Data is partitioned by week, timestamps are stored in ISO-8601 format, and CSV exports are
            generated on-device. Offline Firestore caching ensures uninterrupted use in low-connectivity environments,
            syncing automatically when online.
        </p>

        <p>
            The app is optimized for large rosters, with virtualized lists, minimal entitlements for smooth App Store
            review, and optional monitoring via Crashlytics and Firebase Performance.
        </p>

                    A high-level weekly view that shows each camper’s in/out status for every day, updating in real time
                    across devices through Firestore listeners.

                    <strong>Morning Sign In Flow</strong>
                    Staff quickly scan and tap through a roster of campers to mark attendance, with search and detail
                    views available for deeper context when needed.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Profiles</h2>
        <p>
            Student profiles display each camper’s name, camp photo, and details, along with their attendance history and notes.
            Staff can add or edit notes, update sign-in/out times, and review trends over the course of a week or season.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">View Models</h2>
        <p>
            ViewModels power the app by separating logic from the UI. The AttendanceViewModel parses CSVs, tracks
            sign-ins/outs, and syncs updates to Firestore. LiveAttendanceViewModel streams real-time updates, while
            other ViewModels manage exports, profile details, and admin tools.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Landing Page Experience</h2>
        <p>
            The landing page acts as a clean, intuitive hub for managing daily attendance workflows. Staff can select the
            current day, quickly record morning sign-ins or afternoon sign-outs, open live attendance, or upload new CSV
            data as rosters change, keeping the entire system aligned with real-world camp operations.
